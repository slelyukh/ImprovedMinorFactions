    <string id="IMF9a94b68f" text="Ah, traveler, heed my words, for our village is in need of your strength. The Beni Zilal, the elusive Sons of the Shadows, have established a hideout not far from here. These cunning marauders, with their whispered legends and shadowy origins, now use their secretive base to extort caravans and raid our humble homes.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />
    <string id="IMF4756F533" text="Their mastery of subterfuge and reliance on fear have made them a formidable presence in the Nahasa desert. While they cloak their deeds in tales of mystic preachers and ancient rites, we suffer the consequences of their greed and violence. Destroy their lair, and you will earn not only our gratitude but a reward fitting for such a brave endeavor. Their dark influence must be dispelled so our village can thrive in peace once more.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />
    <string id="IMF55E74123" text="Ah, traveler, may I trouble you for a moment? The Brotherhood of the Woods, once champions of the common folk, have set up a hideout nearby. What began as a noble cause—robbing from the rich to give to the poor—has twisted into something darker. Now, they turn their blades against the very people they once swore to protect, extorting and terrorizing commoners to sustain their dwindling supplies.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />
    <string id="IMF7974E389" text="Their presence disrupts our village's peace, as they have become no better than the bandits they once opposed. We need someone to remind them of their lost purpose or drive them away entirely. Help us, and there will be a reward for your efforts.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />
    <string id="IMF24BFfD76" text="Ah, good traveler, hear the woes of our small village. The Eleftheroi, or 'the free people', as they call themselves, dwell just beyond the reach of imperial law, on the fringe of the steppelands. They are descendants of those who once fled bondage, finding their strength in the freedom of these open lands. Their raids on our stores and their attacks on our people have brought us much grief.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />
    <string id="IMFe8B51B80" text="Their knowledge of the frontier makes them formidable, and their ties to the empire do not temper their hostility towards its rule—or towards us. I beseech you to help protect our village, to push back against their encroachments. Should you manage to curb their aggressions and secure our safety, you will be richly rewarded by our grateful community.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />
    <string id="IMF8d43fd24" text="Ah, traveler, spare a moment for our troubles. The Embers of the Flame, descendants of a long-dead rebellion, have taken root near our village. They claim to be paving the way for the return of Emperor Darusos, a ridiculous notion as if they could raise him from the dead like some campfire ghost story. Their raids and extortions have become an unbearable burden on our people.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />
    <string id="IMF24Ef340C" text="Yes, go to their hideout and give them steel and the flames they worship. Their so-called religion isn't just childish; it's outright heretical and idiotic.

Should you succeed, our village will reward you well.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />
    <string id="IMFe2A00e6d" text="Ah, good traveler, spare a moment for our plight. The Forest People, those dwellers of the deep woods, have been a source of unease for our village. Their practice of swidden agriculture, slashing and burning vast swathes of our shared forest, leaves the land barren and our huntsmen with fewer game. Their ways, though ancient and clever for evading the boyars' tax, threaten the balance we strive to maintain with the land.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />

    <string id="IMF26A5aaBa" text="Ah, traveler, may I have a word? Our village has been plagued by the Hidden Hand, a mafia that has taken root in these parts. These scoundrels, with one foot in the town and the other in the hills, have made a mockery of justice. By day, they pose as respectable traders, but by night, they revert to their true nature—bandits, silencing dissenters and robbing honest merchants.[ib:closed][if:convo_undecided_open]" />

    <string id="IMF7ACf654D" text="Ah, traveler, lend me your ear for a moment. The Jawwal, nomads of the Nahasa desert, once respected as guardians of tradition, now vex us greatly.

    <string id="IMF6C9b9026" text="Ah, good traveler, I find myself in need of your courage.

    <string id="IMFca9d29f4" text="Ah, good traveler, I find myself in need of your aid. Our village lives in the shadow of the Lake Rats, those marauders who dwell on the shores of the great northern lake. They are a wretched band, known for their cunning and cruel trickery, luring Sturgian ships to their doom with false lights and beacons.

    <string id="IMFC38ee489" text="As you likely know the Forest People are nomads and we believe we have the ancient right to use the forests as we please.
